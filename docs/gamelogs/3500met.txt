Here I am my level 12 mage and have the meteor swarm spell memorized.  (I'm wearing a very overpowered armor because my goal is really to show you these years and monsters and how their AI typically works in battle and that would be difficult if I'm always taking damage and dying).  I'm grinding in year 3500 where meteor swarm (without adding ions) will kill most monsters with a couple of casts.  Also, meteor swarm doesn't degrade armor, so monsters armor will not crack as you kill them, so it will drop when they die.  I begin killing monsters and then picking up and inspecting their gear that drops.  I'm looking for new useful gear.  I try on some armors to see their armor class.  I kill a troll wizard.  I find a troll staff and discover that it's a passage clearing rod.  What a find!!  I find a troll skin armor which is enchanted, but it has a relatively low armor class.  An armor called rock shell drops and it has a 35 armor class which is decent-ish for this year, I could potentially enchant it and use it.  I inspect more gear that drops and convert a lot of it to ions.  The meteor swarm spell costs 100,000 ions per cast which is kind of expensive!!  I encounter a Geryon Devil.  It shoots me with a poison bolt from a ranged item and then everything goes to hell.  Poison at this year will quickly drop your HP to 1.  And I happen to run out of ions at this exact moment because the spell casting was so ion-expensive.  I being starving for ions, and since my HP was already at 1 due to the poison, the very first tick of starvation is all it takes to bring my HP to zero and I die.  Because I was carrying so much stuff and the ground already had something on it, my skull and the armor I was wearing vaporizes.  I lost my armor forever.  I enter the game with another character, cast the hide spell, and go to recover my gear that dropped.  Luckily the Geryon did not pick any of it up (this should happen from time to time and makes the game challenging.  A monster will pick up a piece of you gear that drops if you die in their room).
