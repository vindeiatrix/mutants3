Here I am fighting in 2900 with the same character I was using in 4600.  Except this time I'm using my Gold-Chunk instead of a hell-blade to give a different look at damage scaling, and this is a lower year with lower level monsters.  The Gold-Chunk does 21 damage to an armor class of 2.  I think the armor the monsters wear in 2900 are probably around 15ish.  The ground here looks more untouched because I normally don't grind here.  There's a fair amount of spawned items littering the ground but hardly any monster gear.  That's normal for a year untouched by player grinding.  You can see the "Cleric-971" converts his Cleric-Rod early in the fight and then laughs at me because it is a passage making ranged item and he knows they are sought after.  At some point Cleric-971 waves his arms in the air in an attempt to cast a spell, but it seems to fail.  Maybe he did not have enough ions, or more likely the spell just failed due to a bad roll.  Notice the "Sasquatch-331" dodging out of the way., he must have some very high dexterity to be able to do that so much.  Notice how I came across a store and bought it, and how the store mechanics work (markup, markdown, how it effects prices, and everything).  And again, I'm wearing a very over powered armor here so everybody's weapon is just cracking in half and no one can do any damage to me.  At some point during my grind session, I see "You notice an egg is hatching!".  That is the game spawning a monster to replace the ones I'm killing.  It seems to take around 1-5 minutes for them to hatch but it's random.
