
Here is what very early game might look like (except for the fact that there is monster gear and signs of previous battles on the ground because I grinded here recently).  I have a fresh level 1 wizard.  I'm running around a low level year trying to kill some monsters and find some stuff to either sell or convert to ions.  At some point a find a mage staff which has 4 charges and is a nice find for such a low level year.  I think the Mage monster guy drops that one.  I find a Sling-Sword which is a degradable low level weapon and fight a lizard man with it.  He gets the better of me so I travel to the same century which moves me back to the central grid square buying me a few turns to heal.  The lizard man pursues me.  We keep fighting, finally I drain enough of his HP that he goes into his Fleeing mode.  During the time I'm chasing him, I come across a maintenance shop and try to repair my sling sword but I don't have enough money.  Finally I kill the lizard man.  At some point I come across some armor and wear it to gain a little AC, although looking at it sells me it's not in great condition.  Eventually I get enough money to repair my armor, while I dream of a nice enchanted piece of armor that I wouldn't have to repair.  So yeah, this is kind of what fighting looks like in very early game.
