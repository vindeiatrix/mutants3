I am in year 3800 and am grinding with a Flame-Robe and Flame-Sword weapon set I got off of some flame monster in a higher year. I'm using my level 11 Warrior who is choice for melee grinding.  The flame sword does 50 damage to an AC of 6.  The level of monsters here is about right for me to grind this this flame gear and my class and level.  I encounter a chief bugbear and after he readies himself to combat me i lead him to a room with fewer things on the ground to lessen the chance that my armor will vaporize if I die.   I kill him, heal up and check out his drops.  I encounter a mind flayer who's dazzle mace does considerable damage.  I have to do some year traveling mechanics to make some space so I can heal up because if he hits me again we would probably kill me.  I'm finally able to kill him and I keep his dazzle mace because it seems like a fairly powerful weapon and it's already enchanted. I find an Elf staff on the ground.  Probably dropped from monsters fighting.  It has one blast, could be useful so I keep it. I kill a zombie dragon and it drops a wit potion.  I love potions!  I drink it and luckily it's beneficial and not poisonous.  It gives me one more intelligence point.  I try on his golden plate armor, but its worse than what I have.  When I type "wea fl" to put back on my flame armor, the game thinks I tried to put on my flame-sword and tells me hey! that doesn't look like armour!.  that's expected feedback.  I correct it by typing "wear flame-ro" and continue looking for monsters.  I find a night wing.  It doesn't have a weapon but does unusually high innate damage, more than half my hit points. Sometimes monsters don't have a weapon, some don't have any gear at all, or maybe just armor. Some just carry a key or a ranged item or a potion.  What wonderful monster ecology to discover.  At some point during fighting Night-Wing-180 I become exhausted (the flame sword weighs 150 pounds).  However, once I check my stats the exhaustion is already gone because warriors have such high constitution by level 11.  Monsters will try to use anything as a weapon and a lot of them aren't very smart, so the night wing hits me with a monster bait which has a very low power rating. I carry on.  A zombie minotaurs battle axe does decent damage, i have to be careful there.  I encounter a Baluchitherium which has no gear, just some armor that I broke.  I encounter a Renegade elf.  That must be where the elf rod came from.
