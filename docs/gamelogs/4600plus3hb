The following is a log of me playing the original Mutants game on a BBS.  I am fighting monsters in the year 4600.  I am wielding a +3 hell blade which does 75 damage to an enemy with an armor class of 2.  My character stats are:  Str: 68     Int: 109   Wis: 105 Dex: 58     Con: 64    Cha: 98.  You can see the average levels of the monsters in the log.  The armor the monsters wear in 4600 tend to be 40 - 60 armor class.  You can see that some of them like to cast darkness, and one of them has a passage clearing ranged item that they will convert to ions (you can tell because they laugh) during conflict to keep you from getting it (it's treated a bit like a treasure item by the game).  You can tell how monsters behave during battle and the actions they tend to take.  You can also see the experience, ions and riblets they give up upon death for these levels of monsters.  Some of the monsters who carry ranged items tend to use them alot by shooting you with bolts!  You can also tell how the turn system seems to work.  Sometimes the monsters seem to get to take extra actions.  I had been recently fighting in this year which is why you can see some monster gears on the ground already.  I am wearing very powerful armor (AC over 450) which is why you never see me take any damage, and why monsters weapons tend to break on my armor.  Also, the hell blades weight is only 9 pounds which is why I never get exhausted.  The hell blade is one of the best weapons in the game because of how light it is and how much damage it does.
