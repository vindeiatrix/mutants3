1.  existing monsters in catalog need to follow naming convention from examples
2.  when using combat, should select first in list
3.  when player has no current target as ready to combat, wield command should act same as 'hit' command
4.  why are monsters currently clustered around 0,0?  should be spread out.  seem to be same pattern on each year of monsters in 0,0 and -1, 0
5.  on monster kill, the kill block is not the same as the kill text block in examples.
6.  monsters don't are not waking no matter how many times I walk into the tile or "look".  monsters are not fighting back, waking, or doing anything, not taking any turns
7.  monsters are not dropping any gear/items on death
