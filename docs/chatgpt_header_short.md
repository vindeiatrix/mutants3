STRICT PATCH MODE — Generate a Codex task using unified diff patches only. Provide exact file paths and ample context (*** a/... → --- b/... with @@ hunks). Do not add refactors or formatting changes; modify only lines in the diffs. If any hunk can’t apply cleanly, stop and report (no guessing). Include: Task Title, Preconditions, Patches (diff), Acceptance Criteria, and a Smoke Test.
